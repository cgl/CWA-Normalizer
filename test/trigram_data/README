Unfortunately, due to restrictions placed on us by the Twitter.com Terms of Service, we are unable to provide you with the full tweets from which this data was extracted.

This is the data used for the trigram context tests in our paper.  If you would like to perform tests with bigram context, or with no context at all (which seems to be most common), you will need to parse these files to extract the abbreviations and their normalized forms from the center of each phrase in these files.

For each annotator (ann1 through ann5) there are two files:

--- ann1.trigrams.hyp : original abbreviation in (normalized according to ann1) trigram context
--- ann1.trigrams.ref : abbreviation has been normalized according to ann1, appears in the same context as original message.

Words that were not normalized by the annotator are not represented in these files.


=================
As an example, let's imagine the original tweet said:
     <s> hey i luv u hunny :) </s>
And ann1 normalized it as follows:
     <s> hey i love you honey :) </s>

We would see in "ann1.trigrams.hyp":

hey i luv you honey
i love u honey :)
love you hunny :) </s>

We would see in "ann1.trigrams.ref":

hey i love you honey
i love you honey :)
love you honey :) </s>
===============

The phrases have then been randomized within the files so that phrases from the same tweet do not necessarily appear together, to make it more difficult to re-create the original tweet from the trigrams.
